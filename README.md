### Abstract
The paper presents an intelligent, self-adaptive fault recovery and resilience framework for containerized distributed systems to address the limitations of reactive and static fault-tolerance mechanisms.
By integrating continuous monitoring, adaptive fault detection, and automated recovery orchestration, the framework enables proactive handling of container, node, and network failures. The approach supports 
rapid recovery actions such as container rescheduling, service replication, and resource reallocation to minimize downtime and service disruption. Extensive evaluation using reliability metrics such as Mean 
Time Between Failures (MTBF) and availability demonstrates significant improvements over traditional recovery models. Overall, the study establishes that intelligent, automated fault recovery can transform 
containerized systems into resilient, self-healing infrastructures suitable for large-scale cloud-native environments.

### Key Contributions
- **Intelligent Fault Recovery and Resilience Framework:**
  Proposed a self-adaptive fault recovery architecture for containerized distributed systems that overcomes the limitations of reactive and static fault-tolerance mechanisms through automated, coordinated recovery actions.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Adaptive Fault Detection:**
  Integrated real-time monitoring and adaptive fault detection mechanisms to identify container, node, and network anomalies early, enabling timely and accurate failure identification.
  
- **Automated and Proactive Recovery Orchestration:**
  Implemented automated recovery strategies—including container rescheduling, service replication, and resource reallocation—to minimize downtime and prevent cascading failures across distributed clusters.
  
- **End-to-End Design, Implementation, and Validation:**
  Designed, implemented, and experimentally evaluated a complete fault recovery framework, demonstrating substantial improvements in Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), faster recovery, and higher service availability across multiple cluster sizes.
  
### Relevance & Real-World Impact
- **Enhanced System Reliability and Availability:**
  Achieved significant improvements in MTBF and overall system uptime compared to traditional recovery models, ensuring more reliable and dependable containerized services.
  
- **Rapid and Automated Fault Recovery:**
  Reduced service disruption and recovery time by eliminating manual intervention and enabling coordinated, automated recovery actions across containers and nodes.

- **Scalable Resilience Across Distributed Clusters:**
    Demonstrated effective fault resilience as cluster size increases, maintaining stability and reliability in large-scale, multi-node containerized environments.
  
- **Prevention of Cascading Failures:**
  Ensured data consistency and state synchronization during recovery, limiting fault propagation and protecting dependent services from secondary failures.
   
- **Production, Research, and Educational Applicability:**
    Provided a platform-agnostic, scalable reference framework—covering architecture, algorithms, simulations, and empirical evaluation—suitable for deployment
    in cloud-native systems, as well as for academic research and advanced teaching in distributed systems and fault-tolerant computing.
